# Particle Acceleration Hands-On

Tutorial for Particle Acceleration Hands-On session: CTA School 2017, Sao Paulo.

This tutorial is a practical session on simulations of test particle acceleration for the [SÃ£o Paulo School of Advanced Science on High Energy and Plasma Astrophysics in the CTA Era](http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~highenastro/). Theere are several goals of this activity:
- to learn how to integrate the particle equation of motion numerically,
- to help you understand how a charged particle moves in magnetic fields,
- to learn how to analyze a single particle motion,
- to learn how to analyze statistical properties of motion of an ensemble of particles, such as the energy distribution.

[Pre-requisites](./pre-requisites.md), including instructions for [downloading](./pre-requisites.md#download-links) and [installing](./pre-requisites.md#instructions-for-installing-vm) the VM

# Introductory presentation

The introductory presentation is available from [Intro.pdf](https://github.com/gkowal/Particle-Acceleration-tutorial/blob/master/Intro.pdf).

# PAccel code

It is a Fortran code which integrates test particle trajectory (proton or electron) in a predefined uniform or curved magnetic field or magnetic and plasma velocity fields taken from an external simulation.

The code is provided in directory `~/Particle_Acceleration/00_paccel_code/` of your virtual machine image. It can be also downloaded or cloned from GitHub repository:
```
[fermi@localhost ~]$ git clone https://github.com/gkowal/paccel.git
```
There are a few important files which you may want to modify:
- `make.conf` in which several compilation flags are included, in particular test problems are selected here,
- `params.in` in which runtime parameters can be changed.

Once compiled, you can run `./paccel.x` which produces output which looks like

```

It also produces an ASCII file called `output.dat` which contains all particle parameters, such as position coordinates, velocity components, energy, etc.

# Tutorials

## Tutorial 1 - Proton motion in a uniform magnetic field.

In this tutorial we integrate and visualize motion of a proton in magnetic field which is uniform.

Initial steps:
- go to `./00_paccel code/`,
- call `make clean` in terminal,
- make sure the line `TEST=` in `make.config` is set to `WAVE`,
- compile the code: `make`,
- copy the executable file `paccel.x` to directory `../01_Buniform/`, i.e. `cp ./paccel.x ../01_Buniform/`,
- go to directory `../01_Buniform/`, i.e. `cd  ../01_Buniform/`.

There are a few runtime parameters which can be changed in file `params.in`:
- `ptype = 'p'` or `ptype = 'e'` for proton or electron, respectively,
- `xc`, `yc`, `zc` - the initial particle position,
- `vpar` and `vper` for the parallel and perpendicular component with respect to the direction of the local field, respectively, in units of the speed of light, c,
- `bini` - the strength of magnetic field.

**Tasks to do**: Change some of these parameters and visualize the particle trajectory.
- Determine the Larmor radius and gyrofrequency after each modification using the data from file `./output.dat`.
- Using the code output determine the unit conversion necessary to express all results in physical units.

In order to visualize the trajectory, energy or velocity components (parallel and perpendicular to the local field) you can use provided [GNUPlot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) scripts: `plot_trajectory.gpl`, `plot_energy.gpl`, `plot_velocity.gpl`.


## Tutorial 2 - Proton motion in a non-uniform magnetic field. Magnetic mirror case.

In this tutorial we integrate and visualize motion of a proton in magnetic field which has a varying curvature. In the result, the particle is trapped bouncing back and forth. This effect is called **magnetic mirror** or **magnetic bottle**.

Initial steps:
- go to `./00_paccel code/`,
- call `make clean` in terminal,
- make sure the line `TEST=` in make.config is set to `ISLAND`,
- compile the code: `make`,
- copy the executable file `paccel.x` to directory `../02_Bmirror/`: `cp ./paccel.x ../02_Bmirror/`,
- go to directory `../02_Bmirror/`: `cd  ../02_Bmirror/`.

Additionally to all runtime parameters described in the previous tutorial you can also change:
- `bamp` - determines the eccentricy of the magnetic field loop; if `bamp = 0.0` the loop is perpectly circular; for `bamp > 0` it is elongated toward the X direction;

**Tasks to do**: As in the previous tutorial, change some of these parameters and visualize the particle trajectory.
- Determine the Larmor radius in each case using the data from file `./output.dat`.
- Determine moments at which the particle changes the direction of parallel motion.
- Determine the mirror effect condition considering the conversation of magnetic moment and total energy.

In order to visualize the trajectory, energy or velocity components (parallel and perpendicular to the local field) you can use provided GNUPlot scripts: `plot_trajectory.gpl`, `plot_energy.gpl`, `plot_velocity.gpl`


## Tutorial 3 - Proton motion in turbulent magnetic field.

In this tutorial we integrate and visualize motion of a proton in turbulent magnetic field taking into account the turbulent plasma motion (electric field generated by moving plasma). For this, we need external data stored in FITS format, which are available in subdirectory `~/Particle_Acceleration/03_Bturbulent/`.

In order to add support for FITS files, we need to download and compile CFITSIO library:
- download the recent version of CFITSIO library: `wget -c http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/fitsio/c/cfitsio3410.tar.gz`,
- unpack it: `tar xzvf cfitsio3410.tar.gz`,
- go to directory cfitsio: `cd cfitsio`,
- configure the library sources: `./configure`,
- compile the library: `make`,
- copy the library file to the paccel sources directory: `cp ./libcfitsio.a ../00_paccel_code/`

Now, you can continue with the PAccel code compilation:
- go to `./00_paccel code/`,
- call `make clean` in terminal,
- make sure the line `TEST=` in make.config is set to `N`,
- compile the code: `make`,
- copy the executable file `paccel.x` to directory `../03_Bturbulent/`: `cp ./paccel.x ../03_Bturbulent/`,
- go to directory `../03_Bturbulent/`: `cd  ../03_Bturbulent/`.
- run the paccel executable: `./paccel.x`

**Tasks to do**: Change the initial position and velocity of particle some of these parameters and visualize the particle trajectory.
- Write a script in python to calculate the particle energy gain/loss rate and plot how it changes over time (to read ASCII data you can use subroutine [numpy.loadtxt](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html)).
- Determine the mean energy gain rate.


## Tutorial 4 - Analysis of statistical properties of an ensemble of test particles.

In this tutorial we analyze statistical properties of an ensemble of test particles. Determine their power spectrum, identify the thermal and non-thermal part, determine changes of temperature, etc.

Files containing already integrated particle trajectories are provided in your VM image, in directory `~/Particle_Acceleration/04_Bturbulent_multi/`. We have five files containing data for 1000 particles:
- `time.fits.gz` - time moments for all particle snapshots (Ns);
- `components.fits.gz` - velocity components (total, parallel and perpendicular) for all particles (3 x Np x Ns);
- `energy.fits.gz` - the kinetic energy for all particles at all snapshots (Np x Ns);
- `gperiod.fits.gz` - the gyroperiod for all particles at all snapshots (Np x Ns);
- `gradius.fits.gz` - the gyroradius (Larmor radius) for all particles at all snapshots (Np x Ns);

Above, there are provided dimensions of arrays stored in each file, where Np is the number of particles and Ns is the number of snapshots.

In the same directory, you will find several scripts written in python, which with the help of packages NumPy and Matplotlib generate evolution of some quantities, e.g. the energy distribution evolution shown below.

![](./energy_histogram.png "Particle Energy Distribution Evolution")

**Tasks to do**: Using the provided data (e.g. files `time.fits.gz` and `energy.fits.gz`), analyze the final energy distribution of particles:
- prepare the log-log plot of particle energy histogram,
- determine the particle temperature by fitting the thermal distribution,
- determine the inclination of the high energy tail.
